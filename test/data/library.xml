			<title>Brain Rules</title>
			<subtitle>12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home, and School</subtitle>
			<abstract>
				<b>Multitasking is the great buzz word in business today</b>, but as developmental 
				molecular biologist <i>Medina</i> tells readers in a chapter on attention, 
				<b>the brain can really only focus on one thing at a time</b>. This alone is the 
				best argument for not talking on your cellphone while driving. 
				Medina (The Genetic Inferno) presents readers with a basket containing an 
				even <b>dozen good principles on how the brain works</b> and how we can use them 
				to our benefit at home and work. The author says our <b>visual sense trumps 
				all other senses, so pump up those PowerPoint presentations with graphics</b>. 
				The author says that <b>we don't sleep to give our brain a rest—studies show 
				our neurons firing furiously away</b> while the rest of the body is catching 
				a few z's. While our brain indeed loses cells as we age, it compensates 
				so that we continue to be able to learn well into our golden years. 
				Many of these findings and minutiae will be familiar to science buffs, 
				but the author employs an appealing style, with suggestions on how to 
				apply his principles, which should engage all readers.

			<title>The Back of the Napkin</title>
			<subtitle>Solving Problems and Selling Ideas with Pictures</subtitle>
			<abstract>
				The premise behind Roam's book is simple: anybody with a pen and a scrap 
				of paper can use visual thinking to work through complex business ideas. 
				Management consultant and lecturer Roam begins with a watershed moment: 
				asked, at the last minute, to give a talk to top government officials, 
				he sketched a diagram on a napkin. The clarity and power of that image 
				allowed him to communicate directly with his audience. 
				From this starting point, Roam has developed a remarkably comprehensive 
				system of ideas. <b>Everything in the book is broken down into steps</b>, 
				providing the reader with tools and rules to facilitate picture making. 
				There are the four steps of visual thinking, the six ways of seeing and 
				the SQVID– a clumsy acronym for a full brain visual work out designed to 
				focus ideas. Roam occasionally overcomplicates; an extended case study 
				takes up a full third of the book and contains an overload of images 
				that belie the book's central message of simplicity. Nonetheless, for 
				forward-thinking management types, there is enough content in these 
				pages to drive many a brainstorming session.

			<title>Good to Great</title>
			<subtitle>Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't</subtitle>
			<abstract>
				Five years ago Jim Collins asked the question, "Can a good company become a great 
				company, and if so, how?" In Good to Great Collins, the author of Built to Last 
				concludes that it is possible, but finds that there are no silver bullets to greatness. 
				Collins and his team of researchers began their quest by sorting through a list of 
				1,435 companies, looking for those that made substantial improvements in their 
				performance over time. They finally settled on 11--including Gillette, 
				Walgreens and Wells Fargo--and discovered common traits that challenged many of 
				the conventional notions of corporate success. Making the transition from good to 
				great doesn't require a high-profile CEO, the latest technology, innovative change 
				management or even a fine-tuned business strategy. At the heart of those rare and 
				truly great companies was a corporate culture that rigorously found and promoted 
				disciplined people to think and act in a disciplined manner. 
				Peppered with dozens of stories and examples from the great and not-so-great, 
				Collins lays a well-reasoned roadmap to excellence that any organisation would 
				do well to consider. Like Built to Last, Good to Great is one of those books that 
				managers and CEOs will be reading and rereading for years to come.

			<title>Groundswell</title>
			<subtitle>Winning in a World Transformed by Social Technologies</subtitle>
			<abstract>
				Charlene Li and Josh Bernoff define 'the groundswell' as a social structure in which 
				technology puts power into the hands of individuals and communities, not institutions. 
				We see examples of this all around us: Second Life, You Tube, Twitter, etc. 
				The technology that is enabling this has created a permanent, long lasting shift 
				in the way the world works. This compelling and research-based book will not only 
				identify the emerging components of this shift, but will also help companies build 
				their businesses around it, regardless of what specific new technologies come along. 
				The word on social computing has been out for a while. It's game changing. 
				Books like Wikinomics begin to describe what the networked world has become. 
				But institutions of all kinds need more than descriptive context.
				They need tools to navigate the shift in power that social computing and web 
				communities have created. They need data on how their customers use and perceive 
				new media, and guidance about what it means to their business. More than that, 
				they need sophisticated advice that tells them how to turn this new reality to 
				their advantage.

			<title>Made to Stick</title>
			<subtitle>Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die</subtitle>
			<abstract>
				This book explores what makes social epidemics "epidemic" and, as the Heaths cite from 
				Malcolm Gladwell's Tipping Point (2000), defines the secret recipe that makes an idea viral. 
				The principles of stickiness are examined--an unexpected outcome, lots of concrete details 
				that we remember, emotion, simplicity, and credibility--all packaged in an easily told story 
				format. Taking these five stickiness attributes, the book offers numerous examples of how 
				these properties make up the stories we are all familiar with--the urban legend about 
				kidney theft and the razor blades supposedly lurking in Halloween candy. Exercises, 
				checklists, and other tools are sprinkled throughout the book to help the reader 
				understand and test how stickiness can be applied to their ideas, whether they are 
				teachers, parents, or CEOs. Copyright (c) American Library Association. All rights reserved

			<title>Here Comes Everybody</title>
			<subtitle>The Power of Organizing Without Organizations</subtitle>
			<abstract>
				<b>Blogs, wikis and other Web 2.0 accoutrements are revolutionizing the social order</b>, 
				a development that's cause for more excitement than alarm, argues <i>interactive 
				telecommunications</i> professor Shirky. He contextualizes the <b>digital networking 
				age with philosophical, sociological, economic and statistical theories</b> and 
				points to its major successes and failures. Grassroots activism stands among the 
				winners—Belarus's flash mobs, for example, blog their way to unprecedented 
				antiauthoritarian demonstrations. Likewise, user/contributor-managed Wikipedia 
				raises the bar for production efficiency by throwing traditional corporate 
				hierarchy out the window. Print journalism falters as publishing methods 
				are transformed through the Web.

			<title>The Singularity Is Near</title>
			<subtitle>When Humans Transcend Biology</subtitle>
			<abstract>
				Renowned inventor Kurzweil (<i>The Age of Spiritual Machines</i>) may be technology's most 
				credibly hyperbolic optimist. Elsewhere he has argued that eliminating fat intake can prevent 
				cancer; here, his quarry is the future of consciousness and intelligence. 
				<b>Humankind, it runs, is at the threshold of an epoch</b> ("the singularity," a reference 
				to the theoretical limitlessness of exponential expansion) that will see the merging of 
				our biology with the <b>staggering achievements of "GNR"</b> (genetics, nanotechnology and 
				robotics) to create a species of <b>unrecognizably high intelligence, durability, comprehension, 
				memory</b> and so on. The word "unrecognizable" is not chosen lightly: wherever this 
				is heading, it won't look like us. Kurzweil's argument is necessarily twofold: it's not 
				enough to argue that there are virtually no constraints on our capacity; he must also 
				convince readers that such developments are desirable. In essence, he conflates the 
				wholesale <b>transformation of the species with "immortality"</b>, for which read a repeal of 
				human limit. In less capable hands, this phantasmagoria of speculative extrapolation, 
				which incorporates a bewildering variety of charts, quotations, playful Socratic 
				dialogues and sidebars, would be easier to dismiss.

			<title>The Big Switch</title>
			<subtitle>Our New Digital Destiny</subtitle>
			<abstract>
				In this eye-opening look at the new computer revolution and its consequences, <i>Nicholas Carr</i>
				explains why computing is changing and what this means for all of us.
				A hundred years ago, <b>companies stopped producing their own power and plugged into the 
				newly built electric grid.</b>
				The cheap power pumped out by electricity providers not only changed how businesses 
				operated but also brought the modern world into existence. Today a similar revolution 
				is under way as <b>companies dismantle their private computer systems</b> and tap into 
				<b>rich services delivered over the Internet</b>. <b><i>Computing is turning into a utility</i></b>. 
				The shift is <b>remaking the computer industry</b>, bringing competitors like Google 
				to the fore and threatening traditional stalwarts like Microsoft. 
				The effects will reach further as cheap computing changes society as profoundly as 
				cheap electricity did. In this lucid and compelling book Carr weaves together history, 
				economics and technology to explain the "big switch".

			<subtitle>How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom</subtitle>
			<abstract>
				<i>With the radical changes in information production that the Internet has introduced, we stand 
				at an important moment of transition</i>, says Yochai Benkler in this thought-provoking book. 
				The phenomenon he describes as social production is reshaping markets, while at the same 
				time offering <b>new opportunities to enhance individual freedom, cultural diversity, political 
				discourse, and justice</b>. But these results are by no means inevitable: a systematic campaign 
				to protect the entrenched industrial information economy of the last century threatens the 
				promise of <b>today's emerging networked information environment</b>. In this comprehensive social 
				theory of the Internet and networked information economy, <b>Benkler describes how patterns of 
				information, knowledge, and cultural production are changing</b> - and shows that the way 
				information and knowledge are made available can either <b>limit or enlarge the ways people 
				create and express themselves</b>.

			<abstract>
				The motto of the great and the ordinary seems to be: Bet on the expert because crowds

				he fact is that, under the right circumstances, <b>groups are remarkably intelligent</b>, 
				and are often <b>smarter than the smartest people in them</b>. Groups <b>don’t even need to be
